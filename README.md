# Bloxet
Full Bloxet game 

First android game that I uploaded to Google Play.
I was inspired by Tetris for developing Bloxet.

The game is powered by LibGdx game engine that provides many opportunities.
Despite the ugly code that I abandoned in the past, the game performance is good and all movements are smoothly handled.
